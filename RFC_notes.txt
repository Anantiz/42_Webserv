CRLF = /r/n

Http Url:
    http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]
    > If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed.
    > If the abs_path is not present in the URL, it MUST be given as "/"
       when used as a Request-URI for a resource
Uri:
    If Uri is too large return 414
    - A port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default
        port for that URI-reference;

        - Comparisons of host names MUST be case-insensitive;

        - Comparisons of scheme names MUST be case-insensitive;

        - An empty abs_path is equivalent to an abs_path of "/".
